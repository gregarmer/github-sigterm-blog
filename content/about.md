Hi, I'm Greg and this is my personal blog.  You'll find a lot of tech /
programming related posts here, along with posts around some of my hobbies
like photography.

I have a passion for open source software, Linux, UNIX, the quest for perfect
code and doing everything the best way possible.

#### What I do

Iâ€™m a software and systems architect who lives in New York, USA. I work mostly
on systems and network code involving high availability, clustering and
scalable architecture. My day job involves working on a number of web based
enterprise applications, looking after a bunch of servers and generally doing
my part in making the web a better place. I also spend as much time as I can
working on open source software and contributing to the open source community.

#### Interests

My interests include [Python](http://www.python.org/),
[Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) and most things produced by
[Divmod](https://launchpad.net/divmod.org), C / C++, Java, application
architecture, multi-core processing, efficiency, clustering, scalability,
photography and music (mostly the guitar).
