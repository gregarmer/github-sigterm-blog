This is an insanely awesome way to work with your e-mail!  Google have essentially turned your e-mail inbox into a massive todo list, which as it turns out, is actually a nice way to treat it.

The bundling is great, and is pretty accurate from what I've seen.  Also, the extra meta-info they add in to some e-mails seems to be quite useful - things like flight details, or purchases.

Reminders is also great, especially for people like me who e-mail themselves things to remember.

I'm a big fan and really wish I could use it with my red-taped security controlled corporate Exchange e-mail account too.
